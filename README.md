# Catalyst ROSCA Smart Contracts

This repository contains the Haskell smart contracts for the Catalyst ROSCA DApp. These contracts provide the power for campaign creation, the main structure of the contract, and the tools used to complete the project.

## 💎 Smart Contract Highlights
- Automated Fund Rotation
- Collateral & Risk Sharing
- On-chain Transparency
- Flexible Integration

## 📚 Contracts Included
- `ROSCA-SC.hs`: Core contract logic
- `Milestone.sh`: Controls milestone payout

## 🛠️ Tools
- [Haskell](https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix)
- [Lucid](https://github.com/spacebudz/lucid) for manual testing
- [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/) *(optional for newer smart contract syntax)*
- [Cardano CLI](https://docs.cardano.org/) 
- [Marlowe_Playground](https://playground.marlowe-lang.org/#/haskell) for manual testing
